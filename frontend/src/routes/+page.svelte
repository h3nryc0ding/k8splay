	<h1>Welcome</h1>
	<h2>What is this website about?</h2>
	<p>
		This website is a place where I test out new concepts and technologies that interest me. While I
		don&#39;t focus on the visual or responsive part of the website, I do aim to learn as much as
		possible from each project.
	</p>
	<h2>What is the technology stack?</h2>
	<p>Here are the base frameworks used for this:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Backend: Spring Boot</li>
		<li>API: GraphQL</li>
		<li>Frontend: Sveltekit</li>
	</ul>
	<p>In the lower section, you will find the packages or dependencies used.</p>
	<h2>What&#39;s working?</h2>
	<p>
		Currently, this machine is running in the Oracle Cloud on an always-free VM. I set up a microk8s
		cluster which features:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>SSR rendering with direct connection via service discovery</li>
		<li>Redis for temporary data</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		As full-stack features, there is currently only the live chat. There is definitely more to come.
	</p>
	<h2>What&#39;s coming?</h2>
	<p>There is a lot of stuff planned for this.</p>
	<p>Currently, the focus is set to:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>OAuth 2 via Spring</li>
	</ul>
